# DCS-World-Range-Training-Officer

The RTO(Range Training Officer) judges if a fighter was shot down or successfully defeated missile during the Air Force BVR exercise.

In the real life Air to Air Combat training, Fighter pilots don't shoot a real missile but they call they've "shot" misile to the target, and RTO will judge if the target could evade missile from various parameters: shot range, altitude, speed, and target aspect angle at the time TIMEOUT(predicted missile hit time).

DCS World is the most popular modern combat flight simulator, but there missiles guidance is too weak to replicate AFTTP based BVR, and its effective tactics often changes everytime they update and change missile flight model, guidancemodel or beam/chaff resistance.

Therefore, I decided to script the DCS world BVR to explode a fighter who did not evade missile properly...even if the missile was defeated in the DCS 3D world.
